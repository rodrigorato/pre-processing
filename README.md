# pre-processing
Language independent pre-processor, implemented in Racket.

# Running the pre-processor interactively
To have a Racket interpreter running and interact with it, you can use:
`racket -f src/preprocess.rkt -i`

# Running the examples
To execute one of the examples available, you can do:
`racket -f src/example/EXAMPLE_NAME_HERE`, where `EXAMPLE_NAME_HERE` is the name of the example Racket file.
